    <h1>DOM manipulation with D3</h1>
    <p>This should feel pretty similar to the DOM manipulation you just learned how to do in regular JavaScript. This is a good thingâ€”learning it the more general way first will allow us to transfer skills into the D3 world quite easily!</p>
    
    <p>Here is another paragraph, for demonstration purposes.</p>
    
    <p class = "special-paragraph">And this one is a paragraph of class "special-paragraph"</p>
    
    <p class = "special-paragraph">This one has two classes! "special-paragraph" and "another-class". Notice how they're specified separated by a space: p class = "special-paragraph another-class"</p>
    
    <p id = "best-paragraph-ever">Finally, this one has the id "best-paragraph ever".</p>
    
    <div>Within this div, some text is <span>inside a span,</span> and other text is not. <span>This text</span> is inside a span, and the other text is not!</div>
    <span>This is text in a span, but not in a div, so it shouldn't be selected by d3.selectAll("div span").</span>
    <!--Truly could not be more important: INCLUDE THE D3 SCRIPT! --> 
    
    <div id = "add-class">This div has the id "add-class", and we will use D3 to add the class "purple-div" to it.</div>
