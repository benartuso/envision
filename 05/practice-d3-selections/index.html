        <h1>D3 selections practice</h1>
        
        <p id = "change-my-text">1: This is a paragraph with id = "change-my-text. Using d3, select this paragraph, and do the following: 
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>1. Change text to "I am a paragraph whose text has been changed!</li>
            <li>2. Using .style, give the paragraph a border, change the font family to Helvetica, the margins to 10px, and the padding to 10px.</li>
        </ul>

       <p>2: Go into the CSS file linked to this document (practice-d3-selections.css) and write rules for a class that doesn't exist yet. Call it "many-divs", and make sure you reference it in the CSS file as ".many-divs". You can set whatever rules you want for this class, just make sure they'd be noticeable changes to existing divs.</p>
       <p>Once you've done that, use D3 to simultaneously apply that class to all divs on this page. There should be four below.</p> 

       <div>Div 1</div>
       <div>Div 2</div>
       <div>Div 3</div>
       <div>Div 4</div>

       <p>3: Simultaneously change the text of the 4 divs above to "Done with parts 2 and 3!" </p>

       <p>4: Without changing HTML (only using D3), add a new button to the page. Make it's text "click to change to Helvetica", and make it so that clicking it changes the font of the entire page to Helvetica.</p>
