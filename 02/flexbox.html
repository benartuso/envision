    <h1>Intro to CSS layout and Flexbox</h1>
    <p>Hello Envision! This document is best viewed <strong>alongside its accompanying HTML in side-by-side windows.</strong> Brackets makes this super easy to do, and it allows you to interact with the page and change properties yourself to see how things react!</p>
    <strong>Two big caveats on our use of CSS here:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>For adding in the layout styles we're discussing in this document, we're using <strong>inline style.</strong> This is where style is added directly to an element via the attribute style="property:value; property:value" etc. directly in the opening HTML tag. <strong>This is purely to make it easier for you to follow along, and is for demonstration purposes. You should never do this when writing real HTML+CSS!</strong> The best practice is to link in an external CSS sheet, which will allow you to keep your content and style separate.</li>
        <li>Another "do as we say, not as we do" moment: in addition to those styles added in-line, we also have some additional styles in a style tag in the document header. You don't need to pay super close attention to these, because they're mostly cosmetic (adding margins, etc.) to make the document easier to read overall. We mention this here for two reasons:
            <ul>
                <li>In practice, don't do this! Use an external stylesheet, instead.</li>
                <li>If you try to recreate some of the examples and they don't look EXACTLY the same, check what styles we're applying! It's nothing critical, but makes a bit of cosmetic difference.</li></ul></li>
    </ul>
    
    Alright—have fun digging into CSS layout!
	<h2>Normal flow</h2>
    
    <p>Normal flow is the default way that our browsers arrange content.</p>
    
    <p>As you can see, this happens more or less in order from top to bottom, and in the same order that elements are specified in our HTML markup.</p>
    
    <div>Text in this div is on top,</div>
    <div>Text in this div is in the middle,</div>
    <div>...and text in this div is on the bottom</div>
    
    <p>Because that's the order it's specified in our HTML.</p>
    <h2>Inline vs. block elements</h2>
    
    <p>As we discussed last week, most elements have default displays of either <strong>inline</strong>, where the element sits next to other elements and doesn't take up an entire line, and <strong>block</strong>, where the element cannot be in line with other elements, as it takes up an entire line.</p>
    
    <p>This paragraph element is block—it starts a new line.</p>
    
    <span style="color:blue">This is one span</span> <span span style="color:purple">and this is another.</span> These are inline, as they are able to exist on the same line. 
    
    <p>Here's what's new this week: <strong>whether an element is block or inline is not a fixed, immutable property of that element type.</strong> It's a CSS property, called display, and can be changed like any other CSS property!</p>
    
    <h3>Messing with elements' display property:</h3>
    
    <p>We've established that paragraphs have block display. All we really mean here is that they have block display by <strong>default.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p style="display:inline; color:blue">This blue paragraph has its display changed, <strong>via CSS, to inline.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p style = "display:inline; color:red">This red paragraph also has its display changed to inline. </p>
    
    <p>Notice that these paragraphs are now able to coexist on the same line, and behave exactly like inline elements! Similarly...
    </p>
    
    <p>The <strong>strong</strong> property is usually inline. I use it for convenient bolding all the time, especially when writing these tutorials. However, if we change <strong style = "display:block">this particular strong's</strong> display property to 'block' through CSS, it (quite oddly) takes up its own line. Probably better to leave that one as its default, inline!</p>
    
    <p class = "your-turn"><strong>Your turn:</strong>
    below is the HTML element for an unordered list (ul). This is composed through nesting list item (li) bullet points elements inside a ul element (ordered list) <br/><br/>
    By default, they list items display below one each other, as you'd expect. Use CSS to coerce them to display side by side! You can use inline style, the style tag in this doc's header, or your own external stylesheet!
        
    </p>
        <!-- Your turn!-->
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>

    
<h2>Flexbox!</h2>
    <p>Positioning things in documents, using only the above display properties and the occasional exact, pixel-level specification of where something should go, was a huge pain. </p>
    <p>So, an additional display method was developed, called the <strong>CSS flexible box model</strong>, or <strong>Flexbox.</strong></p>
    
    <p>Flexbox helps with the arrangment of multiple items (divs, paragraphs, images, text, etc.) within a container (usually a div).</p>
    
    <h3>Arrangement in a container, without flexbox</h3>
    Here's what putting three divs inside a parent div looks like under normal flow (without flexbox). 
    
    <p>Outer div in orange, inner divs are in blue!</p>
    
    <div class = "container">
    
        <div class = "box">Inner div</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 2</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 3</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>You can see that the divs flow from top to bottom, as we talked about in the top section (Normal flow). This would certainly be fine for some applications (boring web pages, especially) but really limits the ways in which we can design and lay out our pages (and eventually, our visualizations). </p>
    
    <h3>Arrangement in a container, WITH flexbox</h3>
     
    <p>We showed two different values of the "display" css property: "inline" and "block". Flexbox uses a third, "flex"—and a flexbox container is created through placing "display:flex" property on the OUTER (container / parent) div. Let's do this below.</p>
    

    <div style = "display:flex" class = "container">
    
        <div class = "box">Inner div</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 2</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 3</div>
    
    </div>
    
    <p>What changed? The most noticeable difference is that these div elements now look much more similar to "inline" style. Each div is exactly the width of the text inside it, and they flow from left to right (instead of top to bottom, now) in the order they were specified. </p>
    
    <p>So...why not just use display:inline, then?</p>
    <p>The answer is that <strong>Flexbox gives us MUCH more control over how to arrange these elements within the div.</strong></p>
    
    <div style = "display:flex" class = "container">
    
        <div class = "box">Inner div 1</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 2</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 3</div>
    
    </div>
    
    <h3>Switching the flex-direction to determine layout flow</h3>
    <p>The default value of Flexbox's <strong>flex-direction</strong> CSS property is "row", which arranges the divs in a row, as we just saw. We can also change it to "column" for a vertical layout style.</p>
    
    <p><strong>flex-direction: column,</strong> similar to original block display.</p>
    <div style = "display:flex; flex-direction:column;" class = "container">
    
        <div class = "box">Inner div 1</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 2</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 3</div>
    
    </div>
    
      <p><strong>flex-direction: column-reverse,</strong> to switch the order of things around.</p>
    <div style = "display:flex; flex-direction:column-reverse;" class = "container">
    
        <div class = "box">Inner div 1</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 2</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 3</div>
    
    </div>
    
      <p><strong>flex-direction: row-reverse,</strong> to switch the order of things around.</p>
    <div style = "display:flex; flex-direction:row-reverse;" class = "container">
    
        <div class = "box">Inner div 1</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 2</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 3</div>
    
    </div>
    
    <p>Notice that with "reverse," the items build from the right (if row) or bottom (if column) of the container instead of the left and top. This is especially useful for things like <strong>menu buttons on a personal website</strong> or visualization page, which will often concentrate in the top right.</p>

    <h3>Flex wrap: what if we have too many things to fit in one div?</h3>
    
    <p>With default flexbox properties, as you crowd more and more elements into the div, they will squish as far as they possibly can, then eventually overflow the div, leading to a really ugly look and a <strong>loss of important content.</strong></p>
    <strong>There are 15 divs here, but depending on your screen size, a lot of them probably don't show up. Bad!</strong>
    <div style = "display:flex; " class = "container">
    
        <div class = "box">Inner div 1</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 2</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 3</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 4</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 5</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 6</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 7</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 8</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 9</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 10</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 11</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 12</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 13</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 14</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 15</div>
    
    </div>
    
    <p>By adding in the <strong>flex-wrap:wrap</strong> property, we can cause the excess content to overflow down onto a new line in the div, preventing the loss of content!</p>
    
        <div style = "display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap;" class = "container">
    
        <div class = "box">Inner div 1</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 2</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 3</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 4</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 5</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 6</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 7</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 8</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 9</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 10</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 11</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 12</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 13</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 14</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 15</div>
    
    </div>
    
    
    <h3>Arranging content within flexboxes on the PRIMARY AXIS and the justify-content property</h3>
    <p>We won't always want our flex items to just stack in from the left, right, top, or bottom. The justify-content property gives us some control over this: I'll show the 5 different values of it below on the three-div example.</p>
    
    <h4>flex-start: (we're used to this one!)</h4>
       <div style = "display:flex; justify-content:flex-start;" class = "container">
    
        <div class = "box">Inner div 1</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 2</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 3</div>
    
    </div>
    
      <h4>flex-end: compressing to the other side</h4>
       <div style = "display:flex; justify-content:flex-end;" class = "container">
    
        <div class = "box">Inner div 1</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 2</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 3</div>
    
    </div>
    
          <h4>center: aligning things together, emanating out from the center line of container div</h4>
       <div style = "display:flex; justify-content:center;" class = "container">
    
        <div class = "box">Inner div 1</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 2</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 3</div>
    
    </div>
    
    <h4>space-between: no space on the outsides, but equal space BETWEEN items</h4>
       <div style = "display:flex; justify-content:space-between;" class = "container">
    
        <div class = "box">Inner div 1</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 2</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 3</div>
    
    </div>
    
      <h4>space-around: equals space on outsides AND between items</h4>
       <div style = "display:flex; justify-content:space-around;" class = "container">
    
        <div class = "box">Inner div 1</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 2</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 3</div>
    
    </div>
    
    <p>As we just saw, justify-content is used to align items around the MAIN FLEX AXIS. By default, that is the "row", as we discussed earlier, so our main flex axis goes across the div from left to right. If our flex direction was "column," these properties would do the same thing on the vertical axis instead!</p>
    
    <h3>Arranging content on the SECONDARY FLEX AXIS with align-items</h3>
    
    <p>By default, our inner divs "stretch" to take up the whole height of the container. There is a bit of space between the top of the inner divs and the edges of the outer divs, but that's only because we put in a slight "margin" property to make things look a bit clearer.</p>
    
    <p> If we change this property to another align-items value, our inner divs will only be as tall as they need to be to display their content, and we can then align them wherever we want vertically. </p>
    
    <h4>flex-start: At the start of the secondary flex axis (here, the top!)</h4>
    
          <h4>space-around: equals space on outsides AND between items</h4>
       <div style = "display:flex; align-items:flex-start;" class = "container">
    
        <div class = "box">Inner div 1</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 2</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 3</div>
    
    </div>
    
       <h4>flex-end: At the end of the secondary flex axis (here, the bopttom!)</h4>
    
    
       <div style = "display:flex; align-items:flex-end;" class = "container">
    
        <div class = "box">Inner div 1</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 2</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 3</div>
    
    </div>
    
           <h4>center: behaves as expected</h4>
    
    
       <div style = "display:flex; align-items:center;" class = "container">
    
        <div class = "box">Inner div 1</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 2</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 3</div>
    
    </div>
    
    <h3>Importantly, we can (and will!) use both the justify-content and align-items properties together, to align along the two axes.
    </h3>
            
    
    <h4>Combining space-around on the primary (horizontal) axis with flex-end on the secondary (vertical) axis.</h4>

    
       <div style = "display:flex; align-items:flex-end; justify-content:space-around;" class = "container">
    
        <div class = "box">Inner div 1</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 2</div>
        <div class = "box">Inner div 3</div>
    
    </div>
    
    
    <h2>Changing properties of individual items</h2>
    
    <p>We'd be quite limited if all of our flex children needed to take up the same amount of space, as they have in the examples we've discussed so far. </p>
    <p>Thankfully, the flex-grow property allows us to specify the <strong>relative sizes</strong> of the items inside of a flex container.</p>
    
    <p>In contrast to all of the other styles, which have (so far) been applied to the PARENT (flex container), these are applied to the CHILDREN (flex items) inside the parent container, since each will have a different flex-grow factor.</p>
    
     <div style = "display:flex; align-items:flex-end; justify-content:space-around;" class = "container">
    
      
        <div class = "box" style="flex-grow:2">Flex grow of 2</div>
        <div class = "box" style="flex-grow:1">Flex grow of 1</div>
         <div class = "box" style="flex-grow:1">Flex grow of 1</div>
    
    </div>
    
    <p class = "your-turn"><strong>Try it out:</strong> in the above, try out some different values of flex-grow on each of the elements, and see how they change! The sizes are determined by ratios, so 4-2-2 or 8-4-4 will be the same as the 2-1-1 listed above.</p>
    
    <h2>Flex containers in flex containers</h2>
    The most powerful aspect of flex containers is that you can have flex containers INSIDE other flex containers, being displayed according to flex rules! 
    <p>This allows you the pretty limitless flexibility you need to create a well-laid out website. Check this out: (<strong>strongly recommend </strong>looking at the comments in the HTML for the full picture!)</p>

    <h2>Wrapping up...</h2>
    <p>There's lots more to learn with flexbox, and this is really just scratching the surface. Next, we'll use an online tool to help you get a hang of some of these properties, and we'll be uploading some files during the week to talk about the sister properties to flex-grow, which are flex-shrink and flex-basis. Taken together, these will give you a ton of control over the layouts of your sites, and eventually, your visualizations!</p>
