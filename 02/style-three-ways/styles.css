 /*This is how CSS comments work!*/
    
    /* First, the easy stuff. Changing the font for the whole body: */
    body { 
        font-family:Helvetica;
    }
    
    /*Let's add some classes to all of the "span" elements for easier styling. See the classes we added down below to do this. */
    
    /* Styling all the spans for larger text and emphasis. Remember, we use "." then the class name to select for class. */
    .emph {
        font-size:32px;
        font-weight:800; 
        /*Notice the convenience - we can change all at once!*/
    }
    
    /*Now, we'll handle the individual colors. Easy enough! */
    .purple { 
        color:purple;
    }
    
    .blue {
        color:blue;
    }
    
    .coral {
        color:coral;
    }
    
    /*This will save us a ton of time in applying the styles to all of the emphasis spans, while still allowing us freedom to color them differently. Noticed that we typed the lines 'font-size:32px; font-weight:800' just ONCE here instead of THREE times. 
    
    This would be even more important if you had 20 of these elements, instead of 3!*/
    
    /*Similarly, we can grab all the paragraphs in one go, by using the ELEMENT-level selector.*/
    
    p {
        border: 2px solid blue;
        padding: 5px;
    }
    
    /* border: 2px solid blue IS EQUIVALENT to:
        
        border-width: 2px;
        border-style: solid;
        border-color: blue;
    
    Also, border: 2px solid blue IS EQUIVALENT TO:
        border-top: 2px solid blue;
        border-bottom: 2px solid blue;
        border-left: 2px solid blue;
        border-right: 2px solid blue;
    */
    
    /*Let's style that unique paragraph with an id, since there's only one of it. We'll add the id directly into the HTML element below.*/
    
    /*Now use the #id selector!*/
    #funky-paragraph {
        border: 5px dashed green;
        padding:10px;
    }
    
    /* Notice that even though we have two separate rules applied to the funky paragraph, CSS is able to determine that the one applied on its id is more important, and the one we actually want to display. 
    
    More on this laterâ€”the term for it is "selector precedence," but the most important part to know for now is the general rule that IDs get precedence over CLASSES, and CLASSES get precedence over ELEMENT selectors. 
    
    If you applied three styles, one selecting by p { ... }, one by .a-class { ... }, and one by #an-id { ... }, the ones applied via id would overrule those applied by element or class.
