# Envision
This is the repository for Envision, Forge's 10-week Skills Course on data visualization with D3.js. 

Materials for the course are separated out into folders by week, with each week's folder containing completed demos, code walkthroughs, exercise files, and any other resources covered in workshop. 

The resources for each week will be released _after_ that week's workshop, and are intended to be used as references when completing exercises or working on projects. 


## Using these files
Everyone should have created a GitHub account and installed git on their computer in Week 1. **In week 3, we'll teach you how to interact with GitHub via the command line and seamlessly pull these files down to your local machine**. 

If you already know how to do this, that's great! Go ahead. If not, below are some instructions for downloading and interacting with these files in Brackets. This'll work just fine  until we can get your GitHubs set up in Week 3.  

### Download instructions
Here's a tutorial for downloading the intro.html file posted in Week 1 (folder 01), to help explain HTML. 

1. Get into the Envision repo. (If you're reading this, you're probably already here! But here's the link, for redundancy https://github.com/benartuso/envision)
2. Click on the folder you're interested in. In this case, it should be Week 1's folder, 01.
3. Click on the name of the file you're interested in. In this case, it should be **intro.html**.
4. This gives you a nicely highlighted view of the HTML document, but isn't suitable for downloading. **To get the downloadable version, click the "Raw" button on the top right of the box containing the document.** This should open the HTML in a plain text file in your browser.
5. Right click in any of the white space in this plain text file, then click "save as".
6. Save the file in the folder you keep your envision materials in, making sure that the file is saved as an HTML file (should have the .html extension). 
7. In brackets, click "File > Open Folder", then navigate to your envision folder. intro.html should appear in the sidebarâ€”you can now click it and open it with live preview! 


As always, slack us with any questions on this :)
