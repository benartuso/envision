# Envision
This is the repository for Envision, Forge's 10-week Skills Course on data visualization with D3.js. 

Materials for the course are separated out into folders by week, with each week's folder containing completed demos, code walkthroughs, exercise files, and any other resources covered in workshop. 

The resources for each week will be released _after_ that week's workshop, and are intended to be used as references when completing exercises or working on projects.
