	<h1>DOM manipulation: practice</h1>
    Instructions will be included both in this HTML document and in the linked JavaScript file practice-manipulating-html.js, where you will actually implement these changes. 
    
    <h2>PART A: Changing text content</h2>
     Change the title of this page to: "DOM manipulation: practice is going very well!"
    
    <h2>PART B: Changing CSS styles</h2>
    Change the font of ALL text in this document to Helvetica. 
	<script type="text/javascript" src="practice-manipulating-html.js"></script>
    
    <h2>PART C: Shitty night mode</h2>
    <div>We've created a class in the attached stylesheet, called 'night-mode,' that will apply a very shitty night mode styling to the body. Bind the BUTTON below such that when it is clicked, it toggles our shitty night mode on and off.</div>
    <button id = "c-button">Click to toggle shitty night mode</button>
    
    <h2>PART D: Hover</h2>
    <div id = "hover-on-me">hi. write some javascript code so that this line is way easier to read (increase font size to like, 32px) while hovering.</div>
    
    <h2>PART E: (if time, a bit trickier!) Making your first counter</h2>
    <p>If you're very fancy and have finished all of the above in the time allowed, good for you! For a fun challenge, add some event listeners to these two buttons such that you have a working counter that increments (or decrements) by one with each click.</p>
    <button id = "down">Counter go down >:(</button> <span id = "counter">0</span> <button id = "up">Counter go up :D</button>
</body>
