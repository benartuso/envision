/*-------------DOM MANIPULATION PRACTICE----------------*/

//PART A: Change the text in the document's h1 element to "DOM manipulation: practice is going very well!"


//PART B: Change the font of ALL the text in the linked HTML document to Helvetica. 


//PART C: We've created a class in the attached stylsheet, style.css, called "night-mode" that will apply a very shitty night mode to this document's body. Bind the BUTTON below such that when it is clicked, it toggles our shitty night mode on and off.


//PART D: Write some js such that when the div is hovered over, the font size increases to 32px temporarily. 

//PART E: No pressure if you don't get here, but let's try making our first javascript counter to handle user interaction! Bind the two buttons so that they properly change the counter.
