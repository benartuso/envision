//Here is your svg canvas

const svg = d3.select("body").append("svg")
            .attr("width", 250)
            .attr("height", 250)
            .style("border", "1px solid black")

//You should be able to recreate the pattern through creating: 

////7 groups ("g elements"), each containing one circle and one rectangle.

////Use translations to position the groups. DO NOT SET THE CX or CY or X or Y for any individual rectangle or cicle elements! Translations of groups ONLY. 

////Hint: The SVG is 250 px wide and high, which divides evenly into 5 units of 50 - think of this when performing your translations.
