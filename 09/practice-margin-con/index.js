/* Your goal for this assignment is to do all the necessary setup required to have excellently-functioning, best-practice D3 margins. 

Once you've done this, you can use it as a template for all future labeled charts, like on your project. 

The dimensions of your chart will be as follows: 

OUTER CHART WIDTH: 700px
OUTER CHART HEIGHT: 500px

LEFT MARGIN: 60px
RIGHT MARGIN: 30px
TOP MARGIN: 20px
BOTTOM MARGIN: 50px

When you've done this, add a rectangle of the width inner-width and height inner-height. It should be properly situated inside your outer svg, with the appropriate margin on each side. 

*/

//Step 1: Create your margin object to save the 4 margin properties 

//Step 2: Create your outer svg, of width outerwidth and height outerheight. Give it a border so it's visible.

//Step 3: Append a group (your inner canvas) to your outer svg, and translate it over to properly center it in the div using the margins you've specified. (margin.left and margin.top should help here). 

//Step 4: Append a rectangle of width innerWidth (so, outerwidth - margin.left - margin.right) and height innerHeight (so, outerheight - margin.top - margin.bottom). Give it a fill, and check that it's properly positioned within your outer SVG canvas. This will be your drawing space, and the remaining whitespace is where we will put axes!
