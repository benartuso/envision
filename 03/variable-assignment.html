	<h1>Variable assignment in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>Notice how the external JavaScript file is read in via the script tag below this line. It's considered a best practice to have your javascript read in at the end of your HTML body, since reading and executing JavaScript can usually take some time, and it's nice to have your HTML objects and content already loaded during this time. </p>

	<script type="text/javascript" src="javascript/variable-assignment.js"></script>
